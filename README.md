# VRBike

Bike simulator on Unity with OSVR (old Release) and Oculus Rift. The aim of this thesis project is to design and develop a VR-based software that allows the user to land in a virtual world and use a bike to explore it.
The designed system consists in a cyclette with sensors on handlebars and sensors on the flywheel.

In future we will use a real Bike on rollers to get force feedback.

You can watch a demo on YouTube:
